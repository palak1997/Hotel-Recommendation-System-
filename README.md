# Hotel-Recommendation-System-
One of the first things to do while planning a trip is to book a good place to stay. Booking a hotel online can be a tedious task with hundreds of hotels to choose from, for every location. Motivated by the importance of these situations, we decided to work on the task of recommending hotels to users. We used Make My Trip&amp;#39;s dataset, which has a variety of features that helped us achieve an in depth understanding of the process that makes a user choose certain hotels over others. The objective of this hotel recommendation task is to predict and recommend five hotel clusters to a user that he/she is more likely to book given hundred distinct clusters. The selection of the hotel would be on geographical basis that is: state wise, city-wise, rating-wise etc.
